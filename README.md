This isn't finished, I need to package it up into a Gem.

But it will work like this:

    Usage: ssher [options] host
    Where host is a full hostname or a shortcut defined in .ssh/shortcuts.
    Options not recognised by SSHer will be passed to SSH.
            --local x,y,z                Ports on server to forward to local
        -h, --help                       Show this message
